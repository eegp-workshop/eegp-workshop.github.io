We are currently [accpeting submissions](https://forms.gle/ozkZKfXx4bzJMVcg7) for Spring and Summer 2023 paper presentations through March 15. 

The EEPGW online workshop will be held every other week on Fridays between 5:00-6:00 PM Central European Time (8:00-9:00 AM PST, 11:00-12:00 AM EST). Every other meeting will be a paper presentation. This will last one hour. Participants will be expected to read the paper ahead of the meeting. After a brief presentation by the author(s), a discussant will provide comments and suggestions. We then open the floor for further questions and comments from the audience. The first workshop will take place in April, and the last one will occur in July.

We welcome submissions from graduate students at all stages. Submissions could ranging from papers in early stages to well-developed manuscripts and anything in between.  We encourage submissions for projects that use a wide array of methods, including quantitative, qualitative, and a mixed approach.

The Call for Papers asks for the submission of an abstract at this time, with the expectation that the speaker will circulate a manuscript one week ahead of their presentation. 

Please submit your proposal by March 15 2023 [here](https://forms.gle/ozkZKfXx4bzJMVcg7).
