Our monthly writing sessions provide a dedicated writing hour, followed by a block for feedback and troubleshooting. Whether it is an early project idea, research design, or dissertation chapter, we hope for this to be a space to share and improve work at any stage.  

Have a survey instrument, field work plan (interviews, data collection), or preliminary results you want feedback on? Weâ€™re also hosting a writing group for early-stage feedback on June 2 and 30, July 28, and August 25.
