Our monthly writing sessions provide a dedicated writing hour, followed by a block for feedback and troubleshooting. Whether it is an early project idea, research design, or dissertation chapter, we hope for this to be a space to share and improve work at any stage.  

We will include more details on the first writing group session here shortly.
