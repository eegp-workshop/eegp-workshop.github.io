Welcome! The East European Politics Graduate Workshop (EEPGW) is a once a month, online workshop for political science graduate students. We aim to create an environment for those working on East European politics (broadly understood) to seek feedback and build community amongst other graduate students working on similar topics. 

We welcome graduate students at any stage in their career. Feel free to reach out to us at [eepg.workshop@gmail.com](mailto:eepg.workshop@gmail.com) with further questions.

# Call for Papers: Spring/Summer 2023-24 Workshop
We are excited to open our Call for Papers for the Spring/Summer East European Politics Graduate Workshop! If you are interested in presenting your work, please submit your proposal [HERE](https://forms.gle/dP227SVzezYYU1i49) by **11:59 PST Friday March 29th, 2024.** 

The workshop will meet once a month on **Fridays between 11:00-12:00 AM EST (8:00-9:00 AM PST, 5:00-6:00 PM CET) starting late April 2024**. We welcome submissions from graduate students at all stages. Submissions could range from paper drafts in early stages to well-developed manuscripts and anything in between. We encourage submissions for projects that use a wide array of methods, including quantitative, qualitative, and a mixed approach.

As we are organizing this workshop with the aim of fostering an active and engaged community of grad students working on East European politics, we wish to communicate three important policies:
 (1) Repeat submissions from those who have already presented are welcome.
 (2) For the Spring-Summer 2024 workshop we ask that **presenters commit to attending at least four out of the six workshop sessions.** Presenters will be expected to confirm which dates they will attend as a participant prior to being placed on the workshop schedule. 
(3) We prioritize papers from those who previously have attended EEPG workshops as participants or discussants. 

**DEADLINE for submission: March 29, 2024**

The Call for Papers asks for the submission of an abstract at this time, with the expectation that the speaker will circulate a manuscript one week ahead of their presentation. 


# Statement on Russia's War Against Ukraine
The EEPGW wholeheartedly condemns Russiaâ€™s attacks on Ukraine's sovereignty over the last ten years and its recent full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We stand in support of Ukraine and its people as they fight in support of their country and freedom. For more information on the war, and how to support the Ukrainian war effort, refugees, and media, we include resources compiled by [Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute](https://huri.harvard.edu/russia-ukraine-war) and [Razom for Ukraine](https://www.razomforukraine.org/).
