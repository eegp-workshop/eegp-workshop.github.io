Welcome! The East European Politics Graduate Workshop (EEPGW) is a once a month, online workshop for political science graduate students. We aim to create an environment for those working on East European politics (broadly understood) to seek feedback and build community amongst other graduate students working on similar topics. 

We welcome graduate students at any stage in their career. Feel free to reach out to us at [eepg.workshop@gmail.com](mailto:eepg.workshop@gmail.com) with further questions.

# CfP: Graduate Working Group on Democratic Politics and Public Opinion in East-Central Europe Time Sharing Survey and APSA 2025 Pre-Conference Workshop

The East European Politics Grad Workshop is excited to invite applications for participation in a Time-Sharing Survey and Graduate Working Group on Democratic Politics and Public Opinion in East-Central Europe. 

Applicants can submit a public opinion based design to be fielded in an East European country in late Spring 2025 on a time-sharing survey with all costs covered by EEPGW. Successful applicants will participate in a one-day online workshop with other graduate students on 25 April 2025, have their survey questions fielded in the time-sharing survey, and then present their completed projects a pre-APSA workshop on Wednesday 10 September 2025. 

**DEADLINE for submission: February 7th, 2025 Midnight PST**

# Statement on Russia's War Against Ukraine
The EEPGW wholeheartedly condemns Russia’s attacks on Ukraine's sovereignty over the last ten years and its recent full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We stand in support of Ukraine and its people as they fight in support of their country and freedom. For more information on the war, and how to support the Ukrainian war effort, refugees, and media, we include resources compiled by [Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute](https://huri.harvard.edu/russia-ukraine-war) and [Razom for Ukraine](https://www.razomforukraine.org/).
