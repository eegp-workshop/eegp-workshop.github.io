Welcome! The East European Politics Graduate Workshop (EEPGW) is a bi-weekly, online workshop for political science graduate students. We aim to create an environment for those working on East European politics, broadly construed, where peers can seek feedback and build community amongst other graduate students working on similar topics.

Each month we will offer two types of meetings: a read-first paper workshop and writing group. There is no expectation to participate in the writing group in order to present or attend the workshop, and vice versa. 

We welcome graduate students at any stage in their career. Please contact [eepg.workshop@gmail.com](eepg.workshop@gmail.com) with further questions.
