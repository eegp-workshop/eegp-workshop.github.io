Welcome! The East European Politics Graduate Workshop (EEPGW) is a bi-monthly, online workshop for political science graduate students. We aim to create an environment for those working on East European politics, broadly construed, where peers can seek feedback and build community amongst other graduate students working on similar topics.

Each month we will offer two types of meetings. First, there will be a read-first paper workshop where students are invited to share works-in-progress. Second, our monthly writing sessions provide a dedicated writing hour followed by a block for community problem-solving and troubleshooting on work at any stage-- whether an early project idea, research designs, or dissertation chapter. (There is no expectation to participate in the writing group in order to present or attend the workshop, and vice versa.) 

We welcome graduate students at any stage in their career. Please contact [eepg.workshop@gmail.com](eepg.workshop@gmail.com) with further questions.
